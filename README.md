# Flukybot

Yes, you can run a Telegram bot locally in your own browser using JavaScript. No need to install anything since you already have a browser. You're not likely to have your browser online all the time though, so the bot might be a bit fluky. This is mainly a proof-of-concept and a way to experiment with the Bot API with JavaScript.

The example includes receiving messages, sending messages, custom keyboards and using the bot inline. You can easily use other parts of the Bot API using similar code.

You can try it out at [kunal-diwan.github.io/flukybot/](https://kunal-diwan.github.io/flukybot/) or download the [index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kunal-Diwan/flukybot/HTML/index.html) file and open it locally.
